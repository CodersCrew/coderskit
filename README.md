# CodersKit

Set of UI components created inside CodersCrew.

**Storybook:** [See components documentation](https://coderskit.netlify.com)

**Figma:** [See components mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/H3nYAU5AetzPWs04mL8Em5CY/CodersKit?node-id=1%3A2)


## How to run the project locally?

1. Install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install` command. You should do this in the main directory and every of two packages.
2. Run `yarn dev:coderskit` from the main project directory. It will transpile all components from `packages/coderskit`.
3. Open a separate terminal and run `yarn dev:docs`. It will take components generated in the previous step and create a Storybook playground for them.
